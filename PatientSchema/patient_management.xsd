    xlmns attribute defines the root namespace for this schema.  Every child element of <schema> will belong to this namespace.  Not sure what the :xs suffix is for.

    the suffix might be like the variable name you use to represent the URL stored in the attribute, like setting a variable?
    
    targetNamespace attribute - not sure what this is for.
    
    xmlns:tns - I think this lets us define our target namespace so we don't have to keep writing it?  Not sure. But the instructor said the :tns can be anything we want, so that supports the 'variable' convention I was considering earlier.
    
    elementFormDefault - no idea.
